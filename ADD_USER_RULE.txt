Smart Repository Detection and Auto-Push

When working with Git repositories or when the user mentions @gitcommit.mdc, always follow these rules:

Repository Detection Priority

Before prompting for a GitHub repository URL, check in this order:
1. Git Remote: git remote get-url origin
2. Config File: .git-repo-config file (look for GIT_REPO_URL=)
3. Environment Variable: $GIT_REPO_URL
4. .env File: Check for GIT_REPO_URL in .env

Rules to Follow

- NEVER prompt for repository URL if it already exists in any of the above sources
- Only prompt ONCE - if repository URL is not found, ask for it and save it
- Save to multiple locations: Store in .git-repo-config, git remote, and optionally environment variable
- Show status before operations: Display current repository configuration before git commands
- Avoid duplicate prompts: Check ALL sources before asking user
- Document skipped steps: Note which steps were skipped due to existing configuration

Implementation Steps

When setting up git operations or when user mentions @gitcommit.mdc:

1. First, check for existing repository URL:
   - Run: git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
   - Check: grep "^GIT_REPO_URL=" .git-repo-config 2>/dev/null
   - Check: Environment variable $GIT_REPO_URL
   - Check: .env file for GIT_REPO_URL

2. If found, use it and skip prompts:
   - Display: "✅ Repository URL found: [url]"
   - Continue with git operations
   - Do NOT ask for repository URL again

3. If not found, prompt once:
   - Ask: "Enter your GitHub repository URL:"
   - Save to .git-repo-config file
   - Save to git remote: git remote add origin [url] or git remote set-url origin [url]
   - Display: "✅ Repository URL saved: [url]"

4. After saving, never prompt again for this project

Auto-Push Workflow

When user mentions @gitcommit.mdc or commits code:

1. Check repository URL (using priority above)
2. If not found, prompt once and save
3. Stage changes: git add -A
4. Commit with message (following conventional commits from gitcommit.mdc)
5. Push to remote: git push -u origin [branch]
6. Show success message with repository link
