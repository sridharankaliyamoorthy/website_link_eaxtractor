# Git Commit Message Guidelines

Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding/updating tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- `perf:` for performance improvements
- `ci:` for CI/CD changes
- `build:` for build system changes

Format: `type(scope): description`

Examples:
- `feat(api): add user authentication endpoint`
- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue on mobile`
- `docs: update installation instructions`
- `refactor: improve code organization`
- `test: add unit tests for link extraction`

Body (optional):
- Explain the "what" and "why" vs. "how"
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Reference issues: `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`

Footer (optional):
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

## 🚀 Auto-Push After Commit

When you mention `@gitcommit.mdc`, the system will help you commit and push automatically.

### Automatic Options:

**Option 1: Git Hook (Automatic)**
After every `git commit`, you'll be prompted to:
- Set up remote repository URL (if not configured)
- Push to remote automatically

**Option 2: Auto-Push Script**
```bash
./scripts/auto-push.sh "your commit message"
```
This will:
- Stage all changes
- Commit with your message
- Ask for repository URL if not set
- Push to remote automatically

**Option 3: Manual Push**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Setting up remote (if not configured):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

**Note**: The post-commit hook will automatically prompt you for the repository URL if it's not configured, then ask if you want to push.
